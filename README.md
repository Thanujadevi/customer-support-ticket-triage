# Customer Support Ticket Triage System

## Project Description
This project implements a rule-based customer support ticket triage system using Python.
It analyzes customer messages, assigns priority levels, calculates SLA deadlines,
and generates a final report for support managers.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- GitHub

## Key Features
- Text cleaning and preprocessing
- Multi-factor priority scoring (urgency, impact, emotion)
- Priority levels (P0–P3)
- SLA and due-time calculation
- Explainable priority assignment
- Final CSV report generation

## How It Works
Customer ticket descriptions are cleaned and analyzed using predefined keyword rules.
A priority score is calculated and mapped to priority levels.
SLA hours and due times are then assigned based on priority.

## Output
- Final ticket triage CSV file
- Google Colab notebook with implementation
